# Conquer the CKA – Real Kubernetes Scenarios (2025)

This repository provides hands-on Kubernetes exercises aligned with the CKA exam update after February 2025.  
Scenarios are written to look and feel like the real exam: command line, YAML, time pressure, and troubleshooting.

## Overview

The material focuses on practical, exam-style tasks. Examples include:

- Deployments, Services, StatefulSets
- Ingress, storage, PVCs and volume provisioning
- Scheduling, resource limits, quotas, taints and tolerations
- Troubleshooting pods, nodes and cluster failures
- Helm, CRDs and Gateway API

Everything is oriented around actual problems engineers face during CKA.
